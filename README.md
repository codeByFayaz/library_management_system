Step-by-Step Explanation of a Library Management System

Homepage:

Create a main page where users can navigate to different sections of the library system.
Include links to add books, view available books, and other important features.
User Registration and Login:

Allow new users to register by filling out a form with their details (name, email, etc.).
Implement a login feature for users to access their accounts and manage their activities.
Add a Book:

Create a form for librarians or users to add new books to the library.
The form should include fields for the book title, author, ISBN, and other relevant details.
View Available Books:

Display a list or table of all books currently available in the library.
Include columns for title, author, ISBN, and options to delete or edit book entries.
Delete a Book:

Add functionality to remove books from the library system.
Each book entry should have a delete button that, when clicked, will remove the book from the list.
Local Storage:

Use local storage to save the books data so that it remains even after the page is refreshed.
Ensure that any added or deleted book reflects in the local storage to maintain consistency.
User Interface Design:

Use HTML and CSS to create a clean and user-friendly layout.
Style the forms and tables to make them visually appealing and easy to use.
Dynamic Updates with JavaScript:

Utilize JavaScript to manage the addition and removal of books dynamically.
Ensure that when a book is added or deleted, the displayed list updates immediately without refreshing the page.
Search Functionality (Optional):

Implement a search feature to allow users to find specific books quickly.
Users should be able to search by title, author, or ISBN.
Testing and Improvement:

Test the entire system to ensure all features work correctly.
Gather feedback and make necessary improvements or additions to enhance the system.
Summary
By following these steps, you can create a simple Library Management System that allows users to manage books effectively. The system will have essential features like adding, viewing, and deleting books, all while maintaining a user-friendly interface.
